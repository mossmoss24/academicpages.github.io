I am a doctoral candidate in cultural anthropology at the CUNY Graduate Center, where I study machine learning from an ethnographic perspective. I focus on the role of data scientists as producers of knowledge, and am particularly interested in how machine learning and artificial intelligence is shaped by technological, economic, and ethical concerns.

I hold a B.A. in Anthropology from the University of Illinois, an M.A. in Global Studies from Brandeis University, and an M.Phil. from CUNY. I have previously worked as a digital and spatial information specialist for archaeological and environmental projects in the United States and Turkey.
